                <h2>First assignment</h2>
                <p>Hello, this is my first assignment. Don't expect to much from it. On this website we used HTML and
                    CSS. I don't have many experience with HTML or CSS, so I will need to learn a lot. This page is the
                    index.html. Only for this website I will call it the homepage. I have created
                    the website <a href="https://tavernegrenszicht.nl/"> Taverne Grenszicht</a> in the past, but that
                    was with Wordpress and the basics of HTML. So this is going to be a nice challenge for me!</p>

                <h2>Why do I think ICT is for me?</h2>
                <p>I think ICT suits me very well. This is because I wanted to be an ICT professional from an early age.
                    My example has always been my father in ICT because he does it himself. When I'm done with this
                    training, I want to work for his company. His company is SmakICT! I also did an MBO training for
                    this training, the Expert IT systems and devices training. I also completed this very well. Because
                    of this I know for sure that I want to continue learning because I like a challenge!</p>

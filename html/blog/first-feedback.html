                <h2>First Feedback</h2>
                <h5>This is the feedback that I received for Daphne.</h5>
                <P>Hi Xander,</P>

                <p>Find some feedback below for your PCO assignment:</p>

                <p>Motivation:</p>

                <p>Seems you are focused on the far future but could you maybe give some more detail on what your
                    interests are which makes you decide to choose IT? What makes it important for you to be helped
                    further in IT what exactly do you mean by that? Why continue studying when you could already start
                    working with your MBO certificate am I right?</p>

                <p>Job Opportunities</p>

                <p>For the PCO company assignment, I'd suggest you find some companies of real interest to you and
                    figure out the different opportunities they offer. What exactly are those job positions and what
                    would make you want to work for it to become just that? It does not seem to be IT support that
                    interests you for a job position.</p>

                <p>SWOT</p>

                <p>Your strengths certainly are a good thing to have for success in the IT field. Sometimes students
                    who already have managed to obtain MBO level are getting anxious and stressed halfway through the
                    program for the fact they have to study another 4 years while friends seem to be moving on to jobs
                    earning money and settling down. Do you maybe see this as a threat in your case too? How do you keep
                    yourself motivated for another four years?</p>

                <h2>What are my thought about the feedback from Daphne?</h2>
                <p>I think it's good feedback. This makes it very clear what is meant, and the questions also make me
                    think carefully about the different topics. For example, the question why I want to continue
                    studying instead of working with an MBO. I found this a difficult choice in the beginning, because I
                    wanted to work, but I also want a higher diploma. This is because I always have growth
                    opportunities. But also because I can then work at my father's company, because at least HBO is
                    required for this.</p>

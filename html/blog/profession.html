                <h3>What do they tell you about there company culture?</h3>
                <p>
                    It is broadly focused on individual, and according to customer standards. The culture in China is
                    different from that in Europe, for example. Because of this, it just depends on where exactly you
                    work. What I do understand is that it is informal and formal at the same time.

        <h2>Study choise</h2>
        <P>After visiting many different studies, this one appealed to me the most. This is also because I already
          obtained my MBO 4 diploma in Expert IT system and devices.</P>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          he motivation for ICT mainly has to do with creating a certain system/function and using it within a
          company. I really like to see how my software is used. On my last internship I made a program to
          keep track of all stock in the warehouse, and an asset tag was also added to the product with all
          the information the company wanted to know. This was very successful, and is still used after 2
          years. I also rolled out Autopilot/Intune to
          customers for the same company. This all works very well.<br>
          <br>
          I also get motivation for ICT because there is always something new, because technology never stands
          still. That way the work never stays the same. My father also gives me a lot of motivation, because
          I want to achieve the same as him, and preferably even better!

        <h2>After completing the study</h2>
        <p>
          After this training I would like to work in IT. I don't know exactly which function yet because I find many
          functions interesting. Or I still want to move on to university instead of HBO, but we will see.

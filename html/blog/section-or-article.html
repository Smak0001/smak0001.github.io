              <h1>Motivate your study choice</h1>
              <h5>Why did you choose this study programme? Explain your choise in at least 3 sentences.</h5>
                <p>I chose this course to expand my future possibilities in IT.
                  The study is in line with my interests.
                  Knowledge gained will help me further in the IT

          <h1>After completing the study...</h1>
              <h5>What do you want to do after graduating? What profession or position are you interested in? Why? What do you expect to learn during the study?</h5>
                <p>After this training I would like to work in IT. I don't know exactly which function yet because I find many functions interesting. I expect that I am going to learn more than my MBO education and deeper in the different subjects.</p>
          <h1>Extra-curricular activities (e.g. student job and leisure)</h1>
              <h5>Do you work/are you planning to work alongside your studies? What do you do in your spare time? How do you think you can combine this with studying? STUDY</h5>
              <p>At the moment I work in a Café behind the bar. I've been doing this for 5 years. I also occasionally work for my father when he has work for me in IT. In my spare time I like to hang out with friends. But I also like to create projects on the raspberry or on Windows Server 2022. I can combine this with school. So far this has not been a problem.</p>

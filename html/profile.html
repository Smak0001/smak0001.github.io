                    <li>The study is in line with my interests.</li>

                <h2>After completing the study...</h2>
                <h5>What do you want to do after graduating? What profession or position are you interested in? Why?
                    What do you
                    expect to learn during the study?</h5>
                <p>After this training I would like to work in IT. I don't know exactly which function yet because I
                    find many
                    functions interesting. I expect that I am going to learn more than my MBO education and deeper in
                    the
                    different subjects.</p>

                <h2>Extra-curricular activities (e.g. student job and leisure)</h2>
                <h5>Do you work/are you planning to work alongside your studies? What do you do in your spare time? How
                    do you
                    think you can combine this with studying?</h5>
                <p>At the moment I work in a Cafe behind the bar. I've been doing this for 5 years. I also occasionally
                    work for
                    my father when he has work for me in IT. In my spare time I like to hang out with friends. But I
                    also like to
                    create projects on the raspberry or on Windows Server 2022. I can combine this with school. So far
                    this has
                    not been a problem.</p>

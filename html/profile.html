              <p>At the moment I work in a Caf√© behind the bar. I've been doing this for 5 years. I also occasionally work for my father when he has work for me in IT. In my spare time I like to hang out with friends. But I also like to create projects on the raspberry or on Windows Server 2022. I can combine this with school. So far this has not been a problem.</p>

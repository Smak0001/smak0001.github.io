                <h2>First assignment</h2>
                <p>Hello, this is my first assignment. Don't expect to much from it. On this website we used HTML and
                    CSS. I don't have many experience with HTML or CSS, so I will need to learn a lot. This page is the
                    index.html. Only for this website I will call it the homepage. I have created
                    the website <a href="https://tavernegrenszicht.nl/"> Taverne Grenszicht</a> in the past, but that
                    was with Wordpress and the basics of HTML. So this is going to be a nice challenge for me!</p>
                <img class=html-css-picture src="../photos/html-css.jpg" alt="This is me">
                <h2>Why do I think ICT is for me?</h2>
                <p>I think ICT suits me very well. This is because I wanted to be an ICT professional from an early age.
                    My example has always been my father in ICT because he does it himself. When I'm done with this
                    training, I want to work for his company. His company is SmakICT! I also did an MBO training for
                    this training, the Expert IT systems and devices training. I also completed this very well. Because
                    of this I know for sure that I want to continue learning because I like a challenge!</p>

                <h2>Why do I like ICT?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Working on computers is my hobby. </li>
                    <li> I like to learn new things about programming. </li>
                    <li> I find it really interesting how to programme. </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Motivation for ICT. </h2>
                <p>The motivation for ICT mainly has to do with creating a certain system/function and using it within a
                    company. I really like to see how my software is used. On my last internship I made a program to
                    keep track of all stock in the warehouse, and an asset tag was also added to the product with all
                    the information the company wanted to know. This was very successful, and is still used after 2
                    years. I also rolled out Autopilot/Intune to
                    customers for the same company. This all works very well.<br>
                    <br>
                    I also get motivation for ICT because there is always something new, because technology never stands
                    still. That way the work never stays the same. My father also gives me a lot of motivation, because
                    I want to achieve the same as him, and preferably even better!

                <h2>Why is this ICT study good for me?</h2>
                <p>ICT is a good study for me. This is because I am always working on it, so we have turned the entire
                    house into a smart home. But I also make Digital Signage Software ( Docker and Linux )for various
                    companies so that all
                    advertising/news come on a screen. This is used at a football association, and at a restaurant.<br>
                    I also made the website of Taverne Grenszicht, this is a restaurant. I also manage the network
                    infrastructure there.<br>
                    <br>
                    I have also completed an internship at various companies, such as: Aptiv, MediaMarkt, SmakICT,
                    Lantack ICT & Telecom and Bolckmans. I also learned many different things there, such as VOIP, but
                    also building networks, setting up servers and creating websites.<br>
                    <br>
                    I also worked at Lantack ICT & Telecom for 1 year! I really liked it, only because of school I
                    stopped because I don't have enough time. But I am always welcome at the office, so I will
                    definitely come back there after this training!<br>

                    <br>

                    I have also already completed an ICT education at the MBO, I have also completed this education with
                    Cum laude! So I know for sure that ICT suits me!
